    # add_to_list = (models.BooleanFiled) cannot be a field on the product model because we are wanting the user to assign the product to a collection upon initial input of that product into the app. 

    # don't need related names for users because there is only 1 user in this app at all times.

    # created another app for products because collection model in shoppinglist app references products model due to the need for a foreign key for the product field, and the product model references collection model due to the need for a foreign key for the collection field. Placing either one above or below each other in the same model file would always cause a problem for one of the two, depending on which one was below. 

    # There is an issue here with having a collection field in product. This means that a collection must already exist for the user to register a product. This creates a 'chicken before the egg situation' - a never ending loop (as a collection states that a product is a required field). This needs to change.
    # Either the user must be able to add a product without being obligated to assign a collection to it, which will require a separate product serializer, view and url, and/or
    # a user must be able to create collections without stipulating a product.
    # Realistically, they should be able to do both.
